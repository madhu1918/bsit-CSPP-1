That procedure would add the elements to the new list in increasing order, and when every element from the old list has been moved over, we end up with a new sorted list. This type of sorting algorithm is often called Selection Sort.<br><br>selSort implements this without explicitly creating a new list, by maintaining sorted (from position 0 to i-1) and unsorted (from position i to the end) parts of the list. All elements in positions before the iterating variable i are sorted, and unsorted for those positions at i or below. In each iteration, it selects the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list, and swaps it with the element at the ith position. That essentially adds the next smallest element from the old list and appends it to the new. It keeps doing that until the old list is empty (i.e., i reaches the end of the list)."

						"option":"No",

						"feedback":"Incorrect<br>newSort:<br><br>newSort is basically a slight variant of Selection Sort. In each iteration, newSort also tries to find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list and appends it to the sorted part of the list. The only difference here is that instead of finding the smallest value in the unsorted part of the list with minVal and minIndx, newSort maintains that the element at the ith position is the smallest element between the ith and jth positions. So, when j reaches the end of the list, the ith position must have been the smallest element in the unsorted portion (from position i to the end) of the list."
