The basic idea is that every time it finds two successive elements in the wrong order, it will swap them. Because all lists can be sorted, it will eventually run out of things that are in the wrong order. At this point the list is sorted, and the algorithm terminates.<br><br>Another way of thinking about mySort is that in each iteration, if an element e is bigger than the one after it, e moves down one location. Then, e is checked against the next element, and so on, until the algorithm finds an element bigger than e. So, in the first pass, the biggest element drops to the bottom of the list. Then, in the second pass, the second biggest drops to the second to last position in the list, and so on for the remaining iterations. In each pass through the list, the next biggest element drops to its proper location, so that after n iterations, the list is sorted. This algorithm is typically known as 'bubble sort' as elements bubble (up or down) one element at a time."

						"option":"No",

						"feedback":"Incorrect<br>newSort is basically a slight variant of Selection Sort (see previous problem). In each iteration, newSort tries to find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list and appends it to the sorted part of the list. newSort maintains that the element at the ith position is the smallest element between the ith and jth positions. So, when j reaches the end of the list, the ith position must have been the smallest element in the unsorted portion (from position i to the end) of the list."
