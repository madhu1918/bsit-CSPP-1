This is called usability - it's very important, when programming, to consider the usability of your program. If users find your program difficult to understand or operate, they won't use it!<br><br>For this problem, you are free to use spacing in any way you wish - our grader will only check that the letters and underscores are in the proper order; it will not look at spacing. We do encourage you to think about usability when designing.<br><br>For this function, you may assume that all the letters in secretWord and lettersGuessed are lowercase.<br><br>Check your program against the give test cases below as a Zip file.
