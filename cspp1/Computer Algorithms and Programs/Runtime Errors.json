			"points":"1",
			"options":[
				{
					"option":"Attempting to divide by 0.",
					"correct":"True",
					"feedback":"Correct! Python cannot reliably tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that value - you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program)."
				},
				{
					"option":"Forgetting a colon at the end of a statement where one is required.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. This is a problem with the formal structure of the program. Python knows where colons are required and can detect when one is missing simply by looking at the code without running it."
				},
				{
					"option":"Forgetting to divide by 100 when printing a percentage amount.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. This will produce the wrong answer, but Python will not consider it an error at all. The programmer is the one who understands that the answer produced is wrong."
