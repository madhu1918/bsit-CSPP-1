			"questionType":"mcq",
			"questionText":"While writing a program to solve a problem with a high-level programming language, as a programmer, you need to take into consideration the computing platform on which the program is to be executed.",
			"points":"1",
			"hint":
			[
					"Recall what we said about abstraction and high-level programming languages.",
					"An advantage of using a high-level programming language is that it allows one to write programs at an abstraction level higher than the instruction set of the computer.",
					"We can execute a program on any platform as long as an interpreter or compiler exists for that platform."
			],
			"options":[
				{
					"option":"True",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. An important reason for writing programs using a high-level programming language is to avoid what is described. Having to deal with the details of a particular computing platform would divert programmers attention from the problem itself. We write a program once and we can execute it on any platform as long as an interpreter or compiler exists for that platform. In some cases, for example, when we want very efficient programs, low-level languages may be better suited but this is outside the scope of this course"

Rather, it translates and executes instructions one at a time. This is a reason for them being slower than compilers, which separate those phases."
