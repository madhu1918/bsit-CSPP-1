				{
					"option":"programming is the process of writing and gradually debugging a program until it does what you want.",
					"correct":"True",
					"feedback":"Correct! Programming is the writing of the source code and debugging is the process of finding and correcting all the errors within the program until it is correct."
				},
				{
					"option":"programming is creative and debugging is routine.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. Programming can be creative, but it also follows a process and debugging can involve creativity in how you find the errors."
				},
				{
					"option":"programming is fun and debugging is work.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. Some people think that debugging is actually more fun than programming (they usually become good software testers). Debugging is much like solving puzzles, which some people think is fun!"
