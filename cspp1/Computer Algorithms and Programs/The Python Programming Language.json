		{
			"questionType":"mcq",
			"questionText":"Source code is another name for:",
			"points":"1",
			"options":[
				{
					"option":"the instructions in a program, stored in a file.",
					"correct":"True",
					"feedback":"Correct! The file that contains the instructions written in the high level language is called the source code file."
				},
				{
					"option":"the language that you are programming in (e.g., Python).",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. This language is simply called the programming language, or simply the language."
				},
				{
					"option":"the environment/tool in which you are programming.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. The environment may be called the IDE, or integrated development environment, though not always."
				},
				{
					"option":"the number (or \"code\") that you must input at the top of each program to tell the computer how to execute your program.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. There is no such number that you must type in at the start of your program."
				}

		{
			"questionType":"mcq",
			"questionText":"What is the difference between a high-level programming language and a low-level programming language?",
			"points":"1",
			"options":[
				{
					"option":"It is high-level if you are standing and low-level if you are sitting.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. In this case high and low have nothing to do with altitude."
				},
				{
					"option":"It is high-level if you are programming for a computer and low-level if you are programming for a phone or mobile device.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. High and low have nothing to do with the type of device you are programming for. Instead, look at what it takes to run the program written in the language."
				},
				{
					"option":"It is high-level if the program must be processed before it can run, and low-level if the computer can execute it without additional processing.",
					"correct":"True",
					"feedback":"Correct! Python is a high level language but must be interpreted into machine code (binary) before it can be executed."
				},
				{
					"option":"It is high-level if it easy to program in and is very short; it is low-level if it is really hard to program in and the programs are really long.",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. While it is true that it is generally easier to program in a high-level language and programs written in a high-level language are usually shorter, this is not always the case."

		{
			"questionType":"mcq",
			"questionText":"Pick the best replacements for 1 and 2 in the following sentence: When comparing compilers and interpreters, a compiler is like 1 while an interpreter is like 2.",
			"points":"1",
			"options":[
				{
					"option":"1 = a process, 2 = a function",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. Compiling is a software process, and running the interpreter is invoking a function, but how is a process different than a function?"
				},
				{
					"option":"1 = translating an entire book, 2 = translating a line at a time",
					"correct":"True",
					"feedback":"Correct! Compilers take the entire source code and produce object code or the executable and interpreters execute the code line by line."
				},
				{
					"option":"1 = software, 2 = hardware ",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. Both compilers and interpreters are software."
				},
				{
					"option":"1 = object code, 2 = byte code",
					"correct":"False",
					"feedback":"Incorrect. Compilers can produce object code or byte code depending on the language. An interpreter produces neither."
