In this part, you will be able to compare how you as a user succeed in the game compared to the computer's performance. <br><br>You should look at the following two functions: compChooseWord and compPlayHand, before moving on to Problem 7 on the next page.<br><br><b>compChooseWord</b> <br><br>If you follow the pseudocode for compChooseWord, you'll see that the code creates a computer player that is legal, but not always the best. Try to walk through and understand our implementation.<br><br><b>A Note On Runtime</b>: You may notice that things run a bit slowly when the computer plays. This is to be expected - the wordList has 83667 words, after all! <br><br><b>Test Cases to Understand the Code</b>: <br><br>>>> compChooseWord({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6) <br><br>appels <br><br>>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5) <br><br> acta <br><br>>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12) <br><br>immanent <br><br>>>> compChooseWord({'x': 2, 'z': 2, 'q': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12) <br><br>None<br><br><b>compPlayHand</b>Now that we have the ability to let the computer choose a word, we need to set up a function to allow the computer to play a hand - in a manner very similar to Part A's playHand function. This function allows the computer to play a given hand and is very similar to the earlier version in which a user selected the word, although deciding when it is done playing a particular hand is different.<b>Test Cases to Understand the Code:</b> <br><br>compPlayHand({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6) <br><br>Current Hand: a p p s e l <br><br>\"appels\" earned 110 points. Total: 110 points<br><br>Total score: 110 points.<br><br>compPlayHand({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5)<br><br>Current Hand: a a c b t \"acta\" <br><br>earned 24 points. Total: 24 points <br><br>Current Hand: b Total score: 24 points.<br><br> compPlayHand({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)<br><br>Current Hand: a a e e i i m m n n t t<br><br>\"immanent\" earned 96 points.
