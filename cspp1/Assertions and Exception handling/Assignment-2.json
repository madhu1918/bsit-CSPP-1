				"text":"A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that implements the <code>playGame</code> function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the <code>playGame</code> body. Read through the specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the <code>HAND_SIZE</code> constant to determine the number of cards in a hand. <br><br> <b>Testing</b>: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. Try out different values for <code>HAND_SIZE</code> with your program, and be sure that you can play the wordgame with different hand sizes by modifying only the variable <code>HAND_SIZE</code> <br><br> Sample Output <br><br> Here is how the game output should look"},

Most of the printed output actually comes from the code you wrote in <code>playHand</code> - be sure that your code is modular and uses function calls to the <code>playHand</code> helper function! <br><br> You should also make calls to the <code>dealHand</code> helper function. You shouldn't make calls to any other helper function that we've written so far - in fact, this function can be written in about 15-20 lines of code. <br><br> Here is the above output, with the output from <code>playHand</code> obscured: "

Try out the following code. It will separate the first and second line with a space, and the second and third line with a \"?\" rather than putting each on a new line. <code> print('Hello', end = \" \")<br><br> print('world', end=\"?\")<br><br> print('!') </code>"
