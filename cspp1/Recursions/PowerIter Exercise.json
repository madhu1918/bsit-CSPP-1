For example, iterPower(base, exp) should compute base<sup>exp</sup> by multiplying base times itself exp times. Write such a function below.<br>This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer; exp will be an integer >= 0. It should return one numerical value. Your code must be iterative - use of the ** operator is not allowed.<br><br>Check your program against the give test cases below as a Zip file. Submit your Solution(Zip file) when all test cases are passed"
