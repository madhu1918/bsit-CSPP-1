The file ps6.py contains a helper function <code>get_story_string()</code> that returns the encrypted version of the story as a string. Create a <code>CiphertextMessage </code>object using the story string and use <code>decrypt_message</code> to return the appropriate shift value and unencrypted story string. <br><br> Paste your function <code>decrypt_story()</code> in the box below.",
