There is a lot of reading, but it can be done with a reasonable amount of thinking and coding. It'll be helpful if you start this problem set a few days before it is due!<br><br>Let's begin by describing the 6.00 wordgame: This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends, if you've played those. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words out of their letters. Each <b>valid</b> word receives a score, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.<br><br>The rules of the game are as follows:<br><br><b>Dealing</b><ul><li>A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now).</li><li>The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, using each letter at most once.</li><li>Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored).</li></ul><br><br><b>Scoring</b><ul><li>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.</li><li>The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.</li><li>Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.</li><li>For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!</li><li>As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters).</li></ul><br><br><b>Sample Output</b>"
