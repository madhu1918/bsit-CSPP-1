				"text":"The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. The function <b>getWordScore</b> should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.<br><b>Scoring</b><ul><li>The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.</li><li>The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points if all n letters are used on the first word created.</li><li>Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.</li><li>For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') to get (4+1+1+2)*4 = 32). Be sure to check that the hand actually has 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' before scoring the word!</li><li>As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points (the base score for 'waybill' is (4+1+4+3+1+1+1)*7=105, plus an additional 50 point bonus for using all n letters).</li></ul><br><br><b>Hints</b>:<ul><li>You may assume that the input <b>word</b> is always either a string of lowercase letters, or the empty string </b></li><li>You will want to use the <b>SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES</b> dictionary defined at the top of <b>ps4a.py</b>. You should not change its value.</li><li>Do <b>not</b> assume that there are always 7 letters in a hand! The parameter <b>n</b> is the number of letters required for a bonus score (the maximum number of letters in the hand). Our goal is to keep the code modular - if you want to try playing your word game with n=10 or n=4, you will be able to do it by simply changing the value of <b>HAND_SIZE!</b></li><li><b>Testing:</b> If this function is implemented properly, and you run <b>test_ps4a.py</b>, you should see that the <b>test_getWordScore()</b> tests pass. Also test your implementation of getWordScore, using some reasonable English words.</li></ul>.<br>Complete the below code and be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in <b>test_ps4a.py</b><br><br>Check your program against the give test cases below as a Zip file. Submit your Solution(Zip file) when all test cases are passed"
