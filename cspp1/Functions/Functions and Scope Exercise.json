You can assume each function is called with an appropriate argument, as specified by its docstring.<br>If the output can be either an int or a float, select num, which isn't a real Python type, but which we'll use to indicate that either basic numeric type is legal.<br>In fact, in Python, booleans True and False can be operated on as if they were the integers 1 and 0; but it is ugly and confusing to take advantage of this fact, and we will resolutely pretend that it isn't true.<br>What are those line under the function definitions?",
