If evaluating an expression would cause an error, select 'NoneType' and write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes) in the box. While you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.<br><br>Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each problem part is evaluated directly after the previous problem part(s).",
