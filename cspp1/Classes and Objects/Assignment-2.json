					"text":"For this problem, the graders will use our implementation of the <code>MessageC</code> class, so don't worry if you did not get the previous parts correct. <br> <code>PlaintextMessage</code> is a subclass of <code>Message</code> and has methods to encode a string using a specified shift value. Our class will always create an encoded version of the message, and will have methods for changing the encoding. <br> Implement the methods in the class <code>PlaintextMessage</code> according to the specifications in ps6.py. The methods you should fill in are: <br> <ul>  <li><code>__init__(self, text, shift)</code>: Use the parent class constructor to make your code more concise.</li> <li>The getter method <code>get_shift(self)</code></li> <li>The getter method <code>get_encrypting_dict(self)</code>: This should return a COPY of self.encrypting_dict to prevent someone from mutating the original dictionary.</li>  <li>The getter method <code>get_message_text_encrypted(self)</code></li> <li><code>change_shift(self, shift)</code>: Think about what other methods you can use to make this easier. It shouldnâ€™t take more than a couple lines of code.</li> <//ul> <br> Paste your implementation of the entire <code>PlaintextMessage</code> class in the box below.<br><br>Check your program against the give test cases below as a Zip file. Submit your Solution(Zip file) when all test cases are passed"
