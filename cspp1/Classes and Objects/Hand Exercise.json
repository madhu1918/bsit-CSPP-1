You'll then be asked to implement one of its methods. Note that the implementation of the object-oriented version of the hand is a bit different than how we did things with the functional implementation; pay close attention to doc strings and read through the implementation carefully. <br><br> To begin: Download <a href=\"/hand.py\" target=\"_blank\">hand.py</a> and read through the file. Be sure to understand what's going on in the file. Make a few instances of the <code>Hand</code> class, and play around with the existing methods. <br><br>  When you have completed reading through the file, implement the <code>update</code> method. <br><br> Paste the entire <code>Hand</code> class in the box below. <br><br> The <code>__str__</code> method is this:"},
